### Gem tables

Here you can find the tables to be used with the *query programs.  
They need to be in the same path as the executable that uses them, unless specified with `-f`.

This tables have been computed with the respective *build program and then reduced so that their size was approx. 1 MB.  
The length of every table is below, they should be more than enough for the most common recipes.

Full tables with the highest values we could compute can be retrived from the sister repository:
[gemforce-tables](https://github.com/gemforce-team/gemforce-tables).
There you'll find additional tables and lots of information about them.  
From those full tables are extracted the results you see in the [results folder](results).
  
If you are interested in helping me expand them offering coding ability/computational power feel free to contact us,
leaving a [Github Issue](https://github.com/gemforce-team/gemforce/issues).
