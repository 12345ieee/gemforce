### Gem tables

Here you can find the tables to be used with the *query programs.  
They need to be in the same path as the executable that uses them, unless specified with -f.

This tables have been computed with the respective *build program and then reduced so that their size was approx. 1 MB.  
These values are more than enough to query for the most common combine/specces.

Full tables with the highest values we could compute can be retrived from the sister repository:
[gemforce-tables](https://github.com/gemforce-team/gemforce-tables).

From these full tables are extracted the results you see in the [results folder](../tree/master/results).  
If you are interested in helping me expand them over my coding ability/computational power feel free to contact me (12345ieee).
