Gem tables
----------

Here you can find the tables to be used with the *query programs.  
They need to be in the same path as the executable that uses them, unless specified with -f.

This tables have been computed with the respective *build program and then reduced so that their size was approx. 1 MB.  
These values are more than enough to query for the most common combine/specces.

I (12345ieee) keep a set of full tables with the higher values I could compute
and from them I extract the results you see in the other folder.  
If you are interested in getting the full tables
or helping me expand them over my coding ability/computational power feel free to contact me.
