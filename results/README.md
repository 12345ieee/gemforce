### Results naming convention

First part of name describes what kind of recipe this is (leech/managem/killgem).
  
Second part is:  
* comb - it's a combine which should be used with an already built gem  
* spec - it's a spec optimised for using no amplifiers,
         we don't have them anymore, they are far from optimal  
* amps - it's a pair of main gem spec and amps spec in optimal proportions,
         though they don't take the combine into consideration  
* omnia - it's a set of four recipes: a main gem spec and its amps spec in optimal proportions
          and a pair of optimal combines for both, it's the pinnacle of gem "rocket science"

Third part - number(s):  
numbers in the last part specify how many gems go into specific recipe:  
* combN and specN - the combine/spec uses N gems, as easy as it gets  
* ampsG-A - the main gem costs G gems while its amps costs A each  
* omniaS-C - the main gem costs S gems,
             the optimized amps' cost is written only inside the file
             and both the combines require C copies of the main gem/amplifier

### So many choices, so little time

What to choose depends mostly on your grade of foolishness (and on your free time).  
I may write more about this later, in the meantime here is some general advice.

Lower numbers are faster to perform, but higher ones yield bigger growth.  
It's recommended to use highest spec available (you do that only once) and highest
combine you've got patience to perform (have in mind that you have to perform
combines tens of times each game)
