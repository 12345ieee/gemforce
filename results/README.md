### Results naming convention

  First part of name describes what kind of recipe this is.
  
  Second part is:  
    comb - it's combine which should be used for both gem and its amps  
    spec - it's spec optimised for using no amplifiers - you probably don't want
           to use it  
    amps - it's pair of main gem spec and amps spec in optimal proportions, it's
           recommended to use :)
           
  Third part - number(s):  
    numbers in the last part specify how many base gems go into specific recipe.
    Lower numbers are faster to perform, but higher gain bigger growth. It's
    recommended to use highest spec available (you do that only once) and highest
    comb you've got patience to perform (have in mind that you have to perform
    combines tens of times each game)
